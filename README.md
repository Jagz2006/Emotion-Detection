# 🎭 Real-Time Emotion Detection using DeepFace & OpenCV  

This project uses **OpenCV** for face detection and **DeepFace** for emotion recognition.  
It captures real-time video from your webcam, detects faces, and predicts the **dominant emotion** for each face.  

---

## 🚀 Features  
- Detects faces in real time using OpenCV’s Haar Cascade Classifier  
- Analyzes emotions using DeepFace (`happy`, `sad`, `angry`, `fear`, `disgust`, `neutral`, `surprise`)  
- Displays bounding boxes around faces with the predicted emotion  
- Simple keyboard control (`q` to quit)
